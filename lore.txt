I.
Every life is a thread.
It could be thick and strong or weak and frayed.
Every thread has beginning and an end.

II.
Lifethreads intersect and tangle.
It is in these intersections where lifeless things come to be.

III.
Lifethreads oin together to create a grand Pattern.
Reality is nothing but this Pattern.
Without Lifethreads there is only Void.

IV.
There are four ways to change the pattern and impose one's will on the reality.
Faith, Solitude, Love and Death.
Each has its own perils.

V.
Faith of a single Lifethread can change a little. 
Common Faith of a multitude can change a lot.
This is done by the means of Ritual
and by the cutting the Lifethreads not in harmony with the new order.

VI.
Should a Lifethread ever remove itself from the influence of others,
it would no longer be bound by reality.
It would possess untold power and be consumed by madness.
These are the two sides of the same coin.

VII.
Death and Love can weaken the Pattern by removing Lifethreads or joining them together.
One should take care not to dissolve in another, or cut one's own Lifethread short.

VIII.
Some believe the Pattern to be beautiful, if one could see it in all its glory.
Others maintain it is random and chaotic.
The only certainty is that the Lifethreads are bound by its rules.
Joint in both pleasure and agony.
