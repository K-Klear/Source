Adding a new Dweller type workflow:
- Create graphics + boss graphics
- Create atlases
- Create the GO
- Add spawner to world.go
- Add stats to actorStats.lua
- Add icon to call gui
- Add icon into the icon atlas
- Add it to the dwellersList variable
- Add it to the unhash variable in actorScript


Bugs:
- Some hero sprites have bad pixels (lvls 1-3, 10) walk animation, maybe more.
- Too many GOs might be a concern at some point. There should be a system preventing overflow.

Things I had to cut:
- Villagers going around
- Day/night cycle
- Dwellers attacking village with various objectives (kill, abduct, steal gold)
	- Bounties for dead enemies changing depending on how much of a danger each dweller type poses
- Direct interaction with the village
	- Dark cult
	- Sending dread visions to attract heroes
	- Helping or hindering village growth
- Adventurer-based economy for the village. Have it grow as heroes use services.
- More hero types - archers, healers, mages...
- Adventuring parties sticking together
- Double (or triple) cave space by allowing actors to walk on the background
- Making it possible to descend to a lower level without going through *every single enemy* on the current level
- Using gold dropped in the dungeon to create cursed items to help heroes while corrupting them at the same time
- Raising undead
